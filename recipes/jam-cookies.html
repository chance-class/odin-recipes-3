    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup + 1 1/2 tbsp salted butter, softened</li>
      <li>1 2/3 cups powdered sugar</li>
      <li>4 cups flour</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp kosher salt</li>
      <li>2 large eggs, at room temp</li>
      <li>2 large egg yolks, at room temp</li>
      <li>1 cup jam or jelly of choice</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Cream butter in large bowl with mixer. Add powdered sugar and beat on low until <br>
        a crumbly, sandy mixture forms. Gradually add salt and flour, 1 cup at a time, <br>
        while mixing on low speed.</li>
      <li>Mix in eggs and egg yolks initially using the mixer, then finishing with your <br>
        hands to create a smooth, soft, and pliable dough, incorporating all the flour <br>
        at the bottom of the bowl. Gather dough into a ball and refrigerate in a covered <br>
        container for about 2 hours.</li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Adjust the oven racks to the middle rungs. <br>
        Line 2 mini muffin tins with paper liners.</li>
      <li>Measure out portions of the dough and set into the prepared muffin cups. Gently <br>
        roll each dough portion into a smooth ball between your hands and place back into <br>
        the muffin cups. Push a deep well into each ball, and fill wells with jam.</li>
      <li>Bake cookies in the preheated oven until the tops of the cookies look dry, but <br>
        not browned, 13-15 minutes, swapping the trays halfway through.</li>
      <li>Remove trays from oven and transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Enjoy!</p>
